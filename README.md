Project #3 for my training at OpenClassrooms.
Goal for this one was to be able to dynamically update a page, handle a login, admin controls, get, post and delete content via an API, ...

To start the server yourself, you'll need to 
- Node.js 

- Download the backend folder from here: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Portfolio-architecte-sophie-bluel/tree/master/Backend

- Use the cmd to then get in the backend folder and run "npm install" and then "npm start".

- Use any live server (VSCode's Live Server extension is enough) for every function to work.
